# cfb-tools (WiP)

Status
---
The dataset creator is completely working, and the simulator is not complete (work in progress atm).

Running
---
The first thing you must do is create a directory called `sets` in the root folder:

    mkdir sets

You can run the predictor without installing apache, or any other web server by using php itself to run a server:

    php -S localhost:8000
    
Afterwards, just navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser to access the web interface.

Requirements
---
- PHP 5+
- python
